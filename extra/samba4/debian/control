Description: SMB/CIFS file, NT domain and active directory server (version 4)
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file sharing with Microsoft Windows, OS X,
 and other Unix systems.  Samba can also function as a domain controller
 or member server in both NT4-style and Active Directory domains.
 .
 This is a special bundled build, that means that it includes a lot of
 libraries (which are normally provided by the system) to cut down dependencies.

Description: Samba debugging symbols
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file sharing with Microsoft Windows, OS X,
 and other Unix systems.  Samba can also function as a domain controller
 or member server in both NT4-style and Active Directory domains.
 .
 This package provides debugging information for the software in the
 Samba suite. Install it to get a better backtrace in the event of a
 crash.
